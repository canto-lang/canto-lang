"""
Test case: REAL conflict - conditions can overlap.
Both rules use the SAME category, so both can fire simultaneously.
The analyzer SHOULD warn about this.
"""

// Same category used by multiple rules - real conflict
?food_terms resembles "pizza", "burger", "pasta", "salad"

?input meaning "the user input"

// Both rules check the same category - if input matches food_terms, BOTH fire
?result can be "option_a", "option_b"

?result becomes "option_a" when ?input is like ?food_terms
?result becomes "option_b" when ?input is like ?food_terms
